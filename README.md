ERLANG SCRIPT with restricting calls by rules
===========================================================

It was a long time ago, Im only starting ERLANG using, 
and desided to write scripting extension for ERLANG.

At this moment I dont know about ESCRIPT or maybe it yet was 
not written.

I write first verison of ERLS.

Next, I thougth about conceptual vulneriability for metacomputing.
Any system function can be called inside script usually it 
great, but sometime it can be danger by security reason.

And I joing to it option for filtration functions calls and allow it by rules.
